By 2030, the Subscription Era dominated, pushing the traditional value of ownership aside in favour of
disposability and convenience. While renting homes had been a longstanding trend, this era saw
everything up for lease. Appliances equipped with sensors charged users on-the-go, occasionally shutting
down when payments were overdue. Cars weren't exempt, nor were their features. With the latest in
robotics and AI, even empathy became a commodity.<br>
<br>

In this age, where human interactions often felt limiting and cumbersome, we offer the perfection of
tailored companionship. With advanced robotics and AI, we promise AI-driven companions, attuned to
your every unique desire, always ready, devoid of the complexities and unpredictability of human
temperament. But remember, unlike humans who can freely give themselves, our robotic companions
don’t operate for free. And so, we’ve rolled out flexible subscription plans to match your needs and
budget. Opt for our all-inclusive monthly package or the more adaptable pay-as-you-go option, ensuring
you invest only in the companionship you truly seek.
<br><br>
In this installation, the artist dives into this satirical vision, presenting an artefact symbolic of the era: a
self-service kiosk, a portal to curating one's AI companion. This piece isn't a testament to technological
progress but an invitation to introspect. It beckons viewers to ponder the delicate dance between
technology and humanity, prompting questions about the designs and innovations that shape us and the
futures they are nudging us towards. Through this immersive experience, one is led to contemplate the
inherent dangers of commodifying and outsourcing the most intimate aspects of our lives.

Eric Gu's (1991) journey into the realm of AI began unexpectedly while exploring his obsession with
becoming a cyborg. Over the past seven years, he's navigated the intricate balance between humancentric
design and the vast potential of AI.<br><br>
As a design innovation consultant, Eric has helped companies across the spectrum - from Fortune100s to
startups. He helps them bring their visions to life, particularly when it comes to AI-enabled products.<br><br>
In academia, Eric's relentless quest for understanding has carved a distinct path. At Imperial College
London, he was instrumental in shaping the "Augmented Designer" curriculum. Presently, as a Ph.D.
candidate at TU Delft, his work delves into the confluence of AI and the design realm. His most recent
study, "Synthetic Stakeholders," probes the nuanced interplay between humans and AI entities in a world
where traditional boundaries blur.<br><br>
Navigating the intricate nexus of design, technology, and humanity's unfolding narrative, Eric aspires to
contribute meaningfully to a future of a harmonized coexistence amongst all kinds of beings.

AI is becoming ever more prevalent in the artefacts around us – in anything from robots to refrigerators
and clothing. As these products are entering our professional, social and even intimate private lives,
IDE’s 
<a href="https://delftdesignlabs.org/expressive-intelligence-lab/" target="_blank"><u>Expressive Intelligence Lab</u></a>
 is researching how to design them in meaningful and socially
appropriate ways. One practical example is the 
<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2023/io/september/funding-of-2-million-to-develop-social-skills-for-robots" target="_blank"><u>Dramaturgy for Devices project</u></a>.
 TU Delft | Industrial Design
Engineering takes part in this project through the research of Associate Professor 
<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/people/rozendaal-mc/" target="_blank"><u>MarcoMarco Rozendaal</u></a>.
 The project will
research what it takes to develop these social skills. This is an important aspect in our Master;’s pogramme
