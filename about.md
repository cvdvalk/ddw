    <p class="card-text open-sans" style="margin-right:2em;margin-left: 2rem">
        Under the supervision of our newly appointed dean Caspar Chorus at the end of 2022, we have started our exciting journey to set up our very first (!) TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) exhibition at Dutch Design Week 2023. But where do you begin?
        </p>
    <p class="card-text open-sans" style="margin-right:2em;margin-left: 2rem">
    To create a world where dreams are allowed to exist, was the dream of Creative Director and Curator Wing Yan Man. Together with curators Professor Paul Hekkert, Associate Professor Marco Rozendaal, 
Head of Communications Julia Candy and StudioLab manager 
Aadjan van der Helm, we have organized an internal design contest. Everyone was free to join, whether in group, individually, Bachelor or Master student, researcher and staff. The only condition was to describe their future world on themes we as IDE find important: Sustainability, Inclusivity, Health and Technology. 
    </p>
    <p class="card-text open-sans" style="margin-right:2em;margin-left: 2rem">
    Utopian, dystopian, near future, unimaginable, physical, digital: we have read them all and in stages chosen the final 8 installations. These are from 23 designers varying from Bachelor to Master to PhD graduates, incorporating product, service and system design, either sprung from a courses, graduation project or just from scratch. With the help of our 
16 mentors, we have embedded the theory and storytelling behind each.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text open-sans" style="margin-right:2em;margin-left: 2rem">
    Each installation has a powerful vision to tell and to make sure visitors of all ages would be able to participate, we have collaborated with 
design studio <a href="https://northernlight.nl/" target="_blank"><u>NorthernLight</u></a>, production company <a href="https://www.brandwachtenmeijer.nl/" target="_blank"><u>Brandwacht en Meijer</u></a> and graphic designer <a href="https://lukejm.com/" target="_blank"><u>Luke James Miller</u></a> to create an 
immersive experience.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text open-sans" style="margin-right:2em;margin-left: 2rem">
    For sustainability, the exhibition production will be given a new life via <a href="https://www.jutplaats.org" target="_blank"><u>jutplaats.org</u></a> and the pencils are donated to <a href="https://meneerrick.nl/" target="_blank"><u>NGO Meneer Rick</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text open-sans" style="margin-right:2em;margin-left: 2rem">
    We are very proud of our collaborative effort, and we hope to have tickled your interest in Delft Design, to encourage you to dream big and take concrete steps to design for your future. Thank you for all the people who have contributed, designers, collaborators, IDE staff and the many happy visitors we have received.
